# Finite Differences

I'm trying to implement the finite difference method for solving differential equations.

The mathematics is developed [here](http://laurent.claessens-donadello.eu/pdf/lefrido.pdf) as I'm learning it.

## deploy.sh

The script `deploy.sh` is the only working stuff up to now. It does the following things :
* show `git status`
* make clean
* make all 
* launch the unit tests
